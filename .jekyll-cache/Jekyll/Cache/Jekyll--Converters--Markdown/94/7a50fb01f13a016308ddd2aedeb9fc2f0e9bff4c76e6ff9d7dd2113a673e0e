I"•<p>I never finished my first listen of <em>Helplessness Blues</em>. Sure, I found the beginning and middle parts pleasant enough but near the tail end of the record a cacophonous, heinous solo not unlike a sax getting stabbed to death prompted me to immediately turn it off and walk away laughing. What a horrible song! What were they thinking? Never listening to this thing again, thatâ€™s for sure.</p>
