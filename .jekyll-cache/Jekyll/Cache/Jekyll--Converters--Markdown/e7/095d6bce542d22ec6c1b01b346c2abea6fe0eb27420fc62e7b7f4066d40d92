<blockquote>
  <p>My paternal grandfather, when he was in the army in World War II â€” he was over in the South Pacific and he thought he was gonna die. And he wrote a letter to my grandmother and their newborn son, thinking he wasnâ€™t gonna come home. And years later, after he was dead, and then once sheâ€™d passed, I was at her house and I just decided, â€œIâ€™m gonna read this letter.â€ And I probably learned more about him in those few pages than I ever could have sitting in a room with him. I remember going down the road on the [tour] bus one day and thinking, â€œWhat if I could just write a letter to my kid, telling him exactly who his dad was?â€ Like, everything Iâ€™m going through right now, at this point in my life. It was just like, â€œOk, Iâ€™m gonna go make this really pure and beautiful thing for my son and incorporate all this music that I loved, outside of and other than country or bluegrass,â€ which is all Iâ€™ve really had a chance to represent up until now.</p>
