I"ğ7<p>The soundscape and themes in Joanna Newsomâ€™s <em>Divers</em> are as dense and opaque as the unkempt garden on the cover. Among the sea of white-lab autotune vocals heard on todayâ€™s radio hits a harpist sporting an old-style nasally voice straight out of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlUbWNpg1os">Disneyâ€™s Snow White</a> seems so foreign that it might take listeners aback if theyâ€™re not prepared for it. Iâ€™d wager not many people can recall the last time they heard a song containing harp instrumentals, let alone songs featuring them as the vocal leadâ€™s primary backing instrument. This sheds <em>Divers</em> in an almost unworldly glow, as if it exists in a dreamlike plane where time bears no meaning and moves as freely as the wind. This feeling does not seem accidental as time itself is one of the central themes on every single track in <em>Divers</em>. The album as a whole seems to resist attempts to pin it down to a sentence-long elevator pitch, Joanna went on record saying that if it were that easy <a href="http://www.thefader.com/2015/10/19/joanna-newsom-divers-interview">â€œI wouldnâ€™t have bothered making a recordâ€</a>. Indeed, the albumâ€™s lyrics are so layered it can take multiple listens to begin having any idea what sheâ€™s trying to say deeper than the surface-level. With all the double-meanings at play and the inherit difficulty in following along with the albumâ€™s frequent use of time travel <em>Divers</em> will leave you lost in time and space if you donâ€™t take care to follow along. For those that do, what awaits is a grand, never ending opus of love and time whose impact will stay with you long after you lift the needle.</p>

<h2 id="the-great-time-war">The Great Time War</h2>

<p>One of the multiple events that ripple through numerous tracks on the album is the devastating time war waged by the grand 101st Lightborn Elite, a tale told through a mournful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKF-nKnn6VU">sea shanty</a> the likes of which would make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WH2JRfLRP0">The Decemberists</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0CR1IJKMPo">proud</a>. While they arenâ€™t explicitly revealed until the core of the record in â€œWalz of the 101st Lightborneâ€, their reveal gives songs like â€œAnecdotesâ€ and â€œTime, As a Symptomâ€ new context. In â€œWalz of the 101st Lightborneâ€ itâ€™s revealed that a mysterious invading force attacked the world for its resources, resulting in great casualties on both sides as well as the reduction of our once green Earth to nothing more than a dry dustball. Just as mysteriously as they had arrived the invading force soon left, leaving the defeated human race and withered planet in its wake. But as the wells ran dry, we found our salvation!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And we came to see Time is taller<br />
Than Space is wide<br />
And we bade goodbye<br />
To the Great Divide:<br />
Found unlimited simulacreage to colonize!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What luck! What providence! Humanity had at long last unlocked the secrets of time travel. The remaining humans quickly assembled all the men they could muster (leaving women behind in the process, see the albumâ€™s self-titled track) and sent them to the farthest reaches of time and space to scavenge and colonize. Such is how the human race completes the paradox and unwittingly becomes the very enemies that invaded and sapped the Earth in the first place. This remains the state of the human race for most of the album, trapped in an infinite war loop â€œbetween us and our ghostsâ€. Itâ€™s frankly like a plot plucked straight out of a thrilling two-part <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who">Doctor Who</a> episode, I half expected that familiar blue box to come whirling into the album at some point<sup id="fnref:blue-box"><a href="#fn:blue-box" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. It soon becomes clear, however, that thereâ€™s no Doctor coming to save us, and thereâ€™s no happy ending to be found. We loose more than just our precious Earth and our future in this â€œeternal return and repeatâ€, our interpersonal relationships suffer as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before You and I ceased to mean Now<br />
And began to mean only Right Here<br />
(To mean Inches and Miles but not Years);â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point something might be nagging at you, wasnâ€™t there an army or battle of some sort mentioned before? Yes! Track 1, â€œAnecdotesâ€, has carefully laid clues hinting at the true identity of the army and the nature of the war theyâ€™re fighting. One might assume they could possibly be one of the two sides in the time war after listening to â€œWalz of the 101st Lightborneâ€ but a question posed to one of the soldiers by another (Rufous Nightjar) removes all doubt, â€œWhen are you fromâ€? This is a question that only makes sense when asked to those who can traverse freely through time. Since we know â€œpastâ€ Earth doesnâ€™t achieve time travel themselves until the end of the initial attack that means the first people we are introduced to in the album are indeed the illusive, ever present 101st Lightborne Elite, right in the mist of pillaging past Earth.</p>

<h2 id="glorious-divers">Glorious Divers</h2>

<p>Joanna frequently plucks out characters from history to progress the albumâ€™s emotional narrative, many of which could be considered divers in their own right. Take for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Purroy_Mitchel">John Purroy Mitchel</a> from the albumâ€™s second track, â€œSapokanikanâ€. John was a former alderman and later â€œBoy Mayor of New Yorkâ€ who led sweeping reform movements against the Tammany Hall political machine during his short career. Upon failing to get reelected, despite his measurable achievements, he left politics to join the Air Service. During a fateful training exercise, however, his plane took a sudden dive, leaving the unfastened John to plummet to his death. For the listenerâ€”knowing all too well that the New York political machine would later slip back into corruptionâ€”this sad tale fits cosily into Sapokanikan which highlights timeâ€™s ability to indiscriminately erode away all of humankindâ€™s efforts.</p>

<p>Again following the idea of diving to earth from the sky, Joanna hints at another fictional character in the albumâ€™s tenth song, â€œA Pin-Light Bentâ€. She plucks a soothing, quiet scene with her harp of an airplane mid-flight (â€œShort flight, free rows: / I lie down and dozeâ€) only to sing of disaster shortly after (â€œShort flight; free descent / Poor flight attendantâ€). While this is fairly sparse information there seems to be enough clues implying the flight attendant who got a â€œfree descentâ€ is <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9F05EFD6123CE63ABC4851DFB6678389679EDE">the stewardess who fell to her death in 1962</a> when the emergency door on her flight suddenly sprang opened, sucking her out into the open sky. Perhaps by no coincidence this story had also <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/42716">inspired a poem</a> by <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/james-l-dickey">James L. Dickey</a> which follows the stewardessâ€™s stream of consciousness during the last moments of her life as she fell. In this stream, he frequently compared the stewardessâ€™s descent as that of a â€œglorious diverâ€ and often commented on how linear time as we know it seemed to cease as stewardess faced imminent death, as if a veil had been lifted and she was seeing life as it truly was for the first time. Joanna focused on this epiphany specifically in â€œA Pin-Light Bentâ€, leaving listeners with the calming, humbling peace that comes with accepting oneâ€™s own mortality and place in the universe.</p>

<h2 id="eternal-return-and-repeat">Eternal Return and Repeat</h2>

<p>Joanna embraces the notion of non-linear time not only at the thematic level in <em>Divers</em> but also at the meta level with how the songs are orchestrated and ordered. The primary manifestation of this attention to detail is in â€œAnecdotesâ€ and â€œTime, As a Symptomâ€, the bookend, sister songs of the album. At first listen it becomes apparent these songs share a great deal in common such as the key signature and the mourning doves echoing at the songsâ€™ fringes, among other things. These songs share more than just surface level similarities, however, and to see whatâ€™s going on we must dive deeper into the lyrics. In â€œTime, As a Symptomâ€, the first half of the song focuses on a new mother experiencing the joy of life as she cradles her newborn child. As the song progresses and the instrumentation swells we find ourselves being pulled away from this scene and seeing it in the ever growing bigger picture of time, death, and reincarnation. The simple piano we found ourselves with at the start of the song is now a grand orchestral movement growing in size and momentum as Joannaâ€™s singing becomes more sporadic and urgent, as if weâ€™re flying through eternities and lifetimes to the ends of the universe in a matter of a few lyrics. It quickly becomes neigh unintelligible as layers and layers of sound continue to be added, that is until we hear Joanna begin belting out over it a looped, military-style shortwave radio transmission, a plea:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>White star, white ship-Nightjar, transmit: transcend!<br />
White star, white ship-Nightjar, transmit: transcend!<br />
White star, white ship-Nightjar, transmit: trans-</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Joannaâ€™s transmission cuts off mid-word a Mourning Dove calls out over the last ringing notes, now reverberating to the songâ€™s end. Itâ€™s as if the album itself suddenly died, soon to be reincarnated as â€œAnecdotesâ€ back at the beginning of the album. After all, where have we heard the name Nightjar before? Ah! Rufous Nightjar, the solider from â€œAnecdotesâ€ who asked â€œWhen are you from?â€. Joanna here is desperately trying to send a message back in time to Rufous Nightjar, or perhaps humanity as a collective, warning of the infinite disaster they cause and to instead â€œTranscend!â€; to transcend above the hell time travel has caused and transcend out of the infinite war loop, all in the hopes of regaining our lost future.</p>

<p>As it turns out, Joannaâ€™s message didnâ€™t go unfinished. Those that have already listened to the album have heard the rest of it, in fact. For those of you with digital copies, put the album on repeat next time you give it a spin and let it continue a bit past the â€œlast songâ€ so it loops back to â€œAnecdotesâ€. Aside from the instrumentation fade out in â€œTime, As a Symptomâ€ exactly matching that of the instrumentation fade in on â€œAnecdotesâ€, <em>Joannaâ€™s desperate plea is actually completed when you match the lyrics together</em>. The last word in â€œTime, As a Symptomâ€ is â€œtrans-â€œ and the first word of â€œAnecdotesâ€ is â€œsendingâ€, making â€œtransc[s]endingâ€:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>White star, white ship-Nightjar, transmit: trans-<br />
. . .<br />
Sending the first scouts over</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joanna alluded to this indeed being the case in interviews as she carefully avoids referring to â€œTime, As a Symptomâ€ as the last song of the album and instead only refers to it as the albumâ€™s eleventh track. With this being the case, we canâ€™t truly say this album has a â€œstartâ€ or â€œbeginningâ€ in the traditional sense; itâ€™s a perfect lyrical and musical loop, no beginning or end.</p>

<p>However, this revelation carries great implications. It means the transmission didnâ€™t work and the human race has failed to either hear or heed the warning to transcend since theyâ€™re still suck in the paradox throughout the album. Iâ€™m of the opinion that Joannaâ€™s putting this up for the listenerâ€™s interpretation. Perhaps the story is hopeful, that during one of these loops the message will get through to the albumâ€™s characters and the human race will indeed transcend its fate. Perhaps not and the story is grim, with the infinite war loop being mankindâ€™s ultimate fate. This message is both harrowing and hopeful and leaves the listenerâ€™s emotions following the listen as tangled as the albumâ€™s garden cover art.</p>

<p>Throughout many moments in our life time can seem like a linear prison. We wait to grow up. We wait to drive. We wait to graduate. We wait to find love. We wait to die. When weâ€™re in moods like this <em>Divers</em> is a breath of fresh, green air to the soul. As we plunge in with Joanna, we can remember that time is what we make of it; itâ€™s not a prison, but mental blinders we grow into as we age. <em>Divers</em> is that necessary reminder to occasionally take those blinders off, dive back into the joy of life, and transcend!</p>

<h2 id="scavenger-hunt">Scavenger Hunt</h2>

<ul>
  <li>As discussed above, the entire album is constructed to be a perfect, infinite circle. â€œThe Things I Sayâ€ is at the center of this circle, and if you listen closely youâ€™ll notice thereâ€™s some strange audio at the end of the song. If youâ€™re on a turntable, play â€œThe Things I Sayâ€ in reverse, and the strange audio is revealed to be the songâ€™s ending played in reverse, furthering the idea that time moves both ways and foreshadows the albumâ€™s destiny to repeat forever.</li>
  <li>Besides taking inspiration from <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/42716">James L. Dickeyâ€™s <em>Falling</em></a>, Joanna also built off the work of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley">P.B. Shelley</a>â€™s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias">Ozymandias</a></em> in â€œSapokanikanâ€. Give <em>Ozymandias</em> a quick read before listening to â€œSapokanikanâ€ and see if you can pick out all the callbacks!</li>
