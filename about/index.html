        <p>Albums are extraordinary; with just a seemingly simple collection of tracks, artists manage time and time again to capture our hearts and minds with records that are somehow much more than the sum of their parts. This inspired Barrowclift siblings Marc &amp; Michael to reflect on (and borderline obsess over) some such albums from their past and present. How about you join us? Plug in, start Track 1, and let's explore together.</p>

        <p>When not gushing about music with Michael, he can be found working feverishly on <a href="https://barrowclift.me/projects/">other side projects</a>, playing tabletop games with friends, or fussing over coffee. You can peruse his other work <a href="https://barrowclift.me">on his site</a> or <a href="https://barrowclift.social">follow him on the socials</a>.</p>

        <p>In addition to music, his other passions are the great outdoors and engineering. On weekends, you can typically find him on a boat trying his hand at fishing or attempting to throw the perfect wall of water. Known for accidentally arriving at the twelfth plane of torment on his way to the kitchen, saying "sig figs" at inappropriate times, and generally not being a clever man.</p>

        <p>When she’s not tackling projects for a large multi-national consulting firm, you’ll find her running absurd distances for fun or scheming with her husband about the next big trip. Talk to her about being a military wife, Stephen King books, or how to make guacamole the right way.</p>
