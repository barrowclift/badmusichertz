		<p>Albums are the movies and books of sound. With just music and album art as their tools, artists manage to capture our hearts and minds with a seemingly endless breadth of experiences. It can be whisking us away to dream like places of adventure, guiding us through character driven emotional journeys of the human spirit, sonically painting grand operas of time and space, and everything in between. Both Marc and Michael Barrowclift have set out to reflect on both the good and bad albums of their past and highlight brand new ones along the way. Plug in, start Track 1, and let's listen to albums again.</p>

		<p>When not obsessing over music he can be found working feverishly at tech-related side projects, playing board and role playing games with friends, or being overly particular about coffee. You can peruse his past work and computing articles at his site, <a href="http://barrowclift.me">barrowclift.me</a>.</p>

		<p>In addition to music, his other passions are the great outdoors and competitive swimming. He can also be found in the deep recesses of his universityâ€™s engineering hall working with his friends on projects and drawing cartoons on the white boards when no one is looking. Known for accidentally arriving at the twelfth plane of torment on his way to the kitchen, saying "sig figs" at inappropriate times, and generally not being a clever man.</p>
