## Notes

* Carpenters' discography up to their self-titled:
    * 1969's [*Ticket to Ride*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/ticket-to-ride/1434887508)
    * 1970's [*Close to You*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/close-to-you/1423766994)
* Carpenters' [*Christmas Portrait*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/christmas-portrait-special-edition/1434882633), which we discussed at length in [Episode 18](https://badmusichertz.com/post/christmas-portrait).
* [Eagles](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/eagles/1053549)' [*Desperado*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/desperado/635800390), which Michael wrote on at length [here](https://badmusichertz.com/post/desperado).
* [The Beatles](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-beatles/136975)' self-titled, most commonly referred to as simply [*The White Album*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-beatles-the-white-album/1441133180). Marc mused off-hand that *Carpenters*' strikingly simple album art reminded him of *The White Album*'s cover art.
* [Craig Braun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Braun)—credited for the design of Carpenters' iconic typographic logo—is most well known for his work on the [The Rolling Stones](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-rolling-stones/1249595)' ["Tongue and Lips"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue_and_lips_logo) logo.

    ![The Rolling Stones' "Tongue and Lips" logo]({{ site.dropbox }}/{{ page.album-name }}/images/the-rolling-stones-tongue-and-lips-logo.png)

* Michael mused that Carpenters' logo reminded him of [Lucasfilm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm)'s logo, which similarly showcases typographic symmetry.

* Despite his love of the record, Michael said [Lord Huron](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lord-huron/393068687)'s [*Strange Trails*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/strange-trails/962688212) sometimes drags (mentioned when noting how brisk and easy *Carpenters* is for any given listen). Listen to [Episode 2](https://badmusichertz.com/post/strange-trails) for a full deep-dive.
* [John Bettis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bettis), who shares in songwriting credit with Richard throughout the album.
* [Gerry Rafferdy](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gerry-rafferty/5569956), [Randy Newman](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/randy-newman/200900), and [Devendra Banhart](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/devendra-banhart/5621730) to Marc's ears all had similar inflections or delivery to Richard.
* [Paul Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Williams_(songwriter)) and his original performance of ["Rainy Days and Mondays"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOtfqYZH3Ho), which caught Michael's ire since to his ears Paul's delivery had an unusual cadence and timing that failed to properly match the backing instrumental.
* [The Beatles](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-beatles/136975)' ["Yellow Submarine"](). Fun song, terrible anchor for a [Jimmy Buffett](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jimmy-buffett/61232) concert.
* [Lord Huron](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lord-huron/393068687)'s [*Vide Noir*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/vide-noir/1440909604) & [Tame Impala](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tame-impala/290242959)'s [*Lonerism*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/lonerism/1440825369) Michael felt both rode the fine line of being *almost* too over-baked, but were able to stick the landing and make it work.
* ["Groupie (Superstar)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b2xa6cYNpU) by [Delaney & Bonnie](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/delaney-bonnie/461815), which while performed adequately, Marc & Michael both felt didn't capture the track's core essence like Carpenters did.
* ["Superstar"](https://music.apple.com/us/album/superstar/1423235747?i=1423235860)'s backing instrumentals were performed by none other than the [Wrecking Crew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wrecking_Crew_(music)), famous collection of studio musicians who performed for the likes of [Sonny & Cher](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sonny-cher/855411), [The Mamas & The Papas](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-mamas-the-papas/62313), and of course the [Beach Boys](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-beach-boys/562555) on [*Pet Sounds*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/pet-sounds/1440841241).
* Don't lie, [you love that scene from Tommy Boy, too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7ZLIqJ8RN4).
* [Abbey Road](https://music.apple.com/us/album/abbey-road-2019-mix/1474815798)'s [Side 2 Medley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_Road#Medley), arguably the most well known rock medley in history.
* [Lonesome Dove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonesome_Dove_(miniseries)), the miniseries Michael mentioned on the show and has been trying to get me to watch for years.
* [The Zombies](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-zombies/930280)' [*Odessey and Oracle*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/odessey-and-oracle/1719880807), which Marc felt "Druscilla Penny" could slip right into.
* [Henry Menchini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Mancini), highly regarded as one of the greatest film composers in history.
* Go home, Apple Music, you're drunk.

    ![Strange Apple Music results for Michael's "Sometimes Mancini" query]({{ site.dropbox }}/{{ page.album-name }}/images/apple-music-why.jpg)

* [1970's *Lovers and Other Strangers*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jz4qKBUkTPc&pp=ygUqbG92ZXJzIGFuZCBvdGhlciBzdHJhbmdlcnMgZm9yIGFsbCB3ZSBrbm930gcJCX4JAYcqIYzv), featuring the original recording of "For All We Know" by Robb Royer and Jimmy Griffin.
* Michael found [*Fighting Shadows*](https://www.amazon.com/Fighting-Shadows-Overcoming-Becoming-Fully/dp/1400243300) by Jefferson Bethke and Jon Tyson to share similar themes in its use of "shadows" as Randy Sparks' use in "(A Place To) Hide Away".
* In "For All We Know", Michael found it shared some lyrical connections with [Fleet Foxes](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fleet-foxes/275727569)' ["Montezuma"](https://music.apple.com/us/album/montezuma/425059566?i=425059569).
* [Lord Huron](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lord-huron/393068687)'s [*Lonesome Dreams*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/lonesome-dreams-bonus-track-version/1758066410), a record Michael similarly finds to be extremely familiar, comforting, and extremely easy to listen to start to finish.
