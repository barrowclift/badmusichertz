> "The pavement runs out at the little village of Tambor, and we stop for cold drinks. Where the pavement ends and the dust begins is also the place where the time warp takes over. It has been only two days since we were opening Christmas presents in Palm Beach, but now we are bouncing along a dirt road in another world. When you are traveling on a trip like this in the right frame of mind, time and space will change. Things that seemed absolutely necessary two days ago slip from your mind. You find yourself looking out the window of the plane, boat, or car and daydreaming about going native. Time becomes something to be used, not saved. Many years ago, when I first experienced this feeling, I wrote a song about it called 'Changes In Latitudes, Changes In Attitudes.' It worked then, and it's working now, as we drive west to the ocean in the land of pura vida."

> "As we drive to the airport the next morning [in Guadeloupe], we talk about the sentimentality we both seem to hold about the places we came from. Kino is a world traveler, but he is still attached to his roots in Guadeloupe. That kind of connection to the land is also a very Southern trait. I too move around the globe in an almost constant state of motion, but when I think of home, I think about Pascagoula and the eastern shore of Mobile Bay, not Long Island or Florida. Home is where you come from. It is not where you live at the present time, and though I doubt I will ever live in Alabama again, I will always think of it as home."

> Taylor is proud of the musical achievements of Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band, particularly the first three albums, but he feels that somewhere along the line their leader became more interested in making money and using gimmicks onstage than in making quality music.
>  
> "We had a lot of fun, but we were always negotiating for more money and of course he's never been one to let go of that stuff," Taylor said. "I had some issues with him over money and a retirement fund, which we never had, although he did put a little something together for us eventually."
>  
> The concerts began to lose their appeal for Taylor.
>  
> "It had all gotten to be a rote deal. The same old crap, the same show biz stuff, dancing girls and exploding props, this that and the other. I was tired of that. He's a big-time businessman now and I think that's what he really enjoys the most. Music is secondary. And music has always been the most important thing to me."

> "Life is a journey that’s measured not in miles or years but in experiences, and the route your life takes is built not of roads but of songs. How far is it from Key West to Miami? To some it is 147 miles. To me, it is about eleven songs."
