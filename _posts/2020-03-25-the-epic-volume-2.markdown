>
> That was my homage to Charlie Brown, it was my version of "Linus and Lucy."
>

> "The Magnificent 7" is actually about a homage to a band I was playing with a lot. That was the band I started writing a lot of songs for this album with. "Henrietta Our Hero" is about my grandmother, who was a very powerful figure in my family. She was a little small woman, but she did a lot with a very little. She struggled with some mental illness and stuff like that, but even with all that, she helped my dad and all his brothers buy their first homes, she got me my first car, she got my brother his first car, she did a lot for someone who didn't have much to work with.
