## Quotes

> "Balancer's Eye" is one we created ourselves, making up our own myths as we go. We're trying to keep it so all that stuff is still around in this world too. You'll see things that appeared on other records, ideas or names cross over to [Vide Noir]. In movies and literature and comic books, I've always liked where there's connectedness or crossover. We need someone to control the lore and keep tabs on it [laughs].

> SCHNEIDER: You know, I guess I haven't had to yet, so I'm not sure, at least with "Strange Trails." On "Lonesome Dreams" there was kind of a central character named George Ranger Johnson, who is this really underappreciated, prolific author.

> BLOCK: Who you invented, yeah.

> SCHNEIDER: Who I invented, yes. But he - yeah, I do kind of miss George. You know, he might pop back up again some time.

> BLOCK: You haven't seen the last of him yet?

> SCHNEIDER: Haven't seen the last of George Ranger Johnson, no.
