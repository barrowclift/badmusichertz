* [Carpenters' "Superstar"](https://music.apple.com/us/album/superstar/1429177732?i=1429181338), featured in [this classic car ride karaoke scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7ZLIqJ8RN4) from *[Tommy Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Boy)*.
* [Episode 3: "The Christmas Draft"](https://badmusichertz.com/post/the-christmas-draft), where Marc drafts ["Merry Christmas Darling"](https://music.apple.com/us/album/merry-christmas-darling-single-version/1429177732?i=1429179340) & discusses at length with Michael & Aimee.

  * [*Brian Wilson*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/brian-wilson/160379936) (self-titled, 1988). Certain segments and tracks on this record strongly resemble Richard's on tracks like "It Came Upon A Midnight Clear".
  * [*That's Why God Made the Radio*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/thats-why-god-made-the-radio/715466841) (2012), which Michael felt too strongly resembled Richard's vocal style (and not in a good way).

  * [Beach House](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/beach-house/200823564)'s [Victoria Legrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Legrand)
* [May Crowning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_devotions_to_the_Blessed_Virgin_Mary), you know, where songs like "Ave Maria" *actually* belong.
* ["Is 'Ave Maria' really a Christmas song?"](https://marcminter.com/2018/12/04/is-ave-maria-really-a-christmas-song/) by Marc Minter, a senior pastor of First Baptist Church of Diana, TX. The correct answer is, "it's not."
