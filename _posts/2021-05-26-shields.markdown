## Quotes

> Chris Bear and I went to Mexico for a month. It was in Baja, this cute little cheap place. There was no one around, no cell reception. We could focus on doing stuff. We wrote ten songs and were so stoked. Then we brought it to the other two guys and they were like, "We're not understanding what you're going for here. This isn't really our vibe." We were deflated. The only song from the Mexico sessions that made it was "Yet Again."
